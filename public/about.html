<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ayyappa Bhagwati Vishwanath, and I am a multi-faceted individual with a wide range of interests. 
  My core passion  and hobbies revolve around Information Technology. When I'm not attending social events or gatherings 
  with friends, you can usually   find me engrossed in my laptop, pursuing various learning endeavors I've always aspired 
  to undertake. For instance, I've long held a  desire to create my own website, and I've made several attempts in the past. 
  I explored and even subscribed to paid services such as wix.com and AWS storage, but I was never fully satisfied with their 
  infrastructure. These services often require you to pay more as  your needs grow, and additional charges may apply if you 
  exceed storage limits.</p>

<p>Recently, I made a firm decision to learn how to build my website from scratch, complete with my own user interface, 
  database, scripts, and more. This is undoubtedly a challenging and long-term goal, especially considering my past struggles 
  with maintaining long-term learning objectives. However, this time, I am rejuvenated and determined to succeed.</p>

<p>I find myself more passionate and committed than ever before to achieve this goal. I have enrolled in a new bootcamp 
  course, dedicating more and more time to learn step by step. I eagerly tackle the challenges and assignments that come 
  with each course, and I am delighted to witness daily progress in my journey.</p>
